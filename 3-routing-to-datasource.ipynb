Pythagoras is known for his contributions to geometry, number theory, and mathematical philosophy. He is best known for the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that mathematics as a field has a long and complex history, and there were many mathematicians who made significant contributions before Pythagoras. For example, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians developed sophisticated mathematical systems for use in engineering, astronomy, and commerce. In ancient India, mathematicians made significant contributions to the development of arithmetic and geometry. And in ancient China, mathematicians developed methods for solving equations and calculating areas and volumes.\n\nSo while Pythagoras is often called the father of mathematics, it is important to recognize the contributions of many other cultures and mathematicians to the development of the field.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Query structuring for metadata filters","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain_community.document_loaders import YoutubeLoader\n\ndocs = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url(\n    \"https://www.youtube.com/live/CzeLannZJ-E?si=8tfn2C6wRhQsNk65\",language=\"hi\", add_video_info=True).load()\n\ndocs[0].metadata","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-05T06:25:55.551049Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-05T06:25:55.551700Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-05T06:25:56.840518Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-05T06:25:55.551654Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-05T06:25:56.839219Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"execution_count":41,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'source': 'CzeLannZJ-E',\n 'title': 'Free AI Course | Lecture 38 | RAG Systems',\n 'description': 'Unknown',\n 'view_count': 4977,\n 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzeLannZJ-E/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGEwgSihlMA8=&rs=AOn4CLC896By8GN3qspgAbF7CaKmTrwW9g',\n 'publish_date': '2024-09-03 00:00:00',\n 'length': 3290,\n 'author': 'Irfan Malik'}"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
